Program prototypes

## Balloon Game
A passion project mobile game made using unity game engine. Balloons will appear from the bottom of the screen and pop automatically if a balloon reaches the top. The game will end automatically if a balloon reaches the top. The game has two modes:
### Endless Mode
Progressively challenging, where the more balloons you can pop the higher the level gets, the harder the difficulty.
### Leveled Mode
Each level the balloons gain speed and become harder to pop.

## Fly Game

## Colour Detection Game
